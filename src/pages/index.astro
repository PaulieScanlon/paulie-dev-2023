  <p>Hey there! <span role='img' aria-label='waving hand emoji'>ðŸ‘‹</span></p>
  <p>
    I'm Paul and a long long time ago I was a designer, but after a few years of pixel pushing I realized code is just
    better. I've held various positions in and around advertising, tech and web/application development in both full
    time, and contract positions since 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
    I once co-founded and ran an award winning digital production agency based in London called
    <a href='https://vimeo.com/109836047' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Super natural</a>. I started the company from
    my kitchen and grew it to a team of 10. From 2012 to 2016 I was hands-on designer/developer, and Technical Director
    / CTO.
  </p>
  <p>
    I now work at <s class='font-light text-brand-text'>Gatsby</s>{' '}
    <s class='font-light text-brand-text'>Cockroach Labs</s>{' '}
