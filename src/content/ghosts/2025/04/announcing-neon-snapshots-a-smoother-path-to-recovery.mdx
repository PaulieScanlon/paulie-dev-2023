Bounce back from setbacks with read-only snapshots designed for disaster recovery, safe testing, and stress-free rollbacks.

When working with databases, there are moments when you’d love to freeze time — before making a big change, running a migration, or simply bookmarking a stable state. With snapshots in Neon, that’s now possible. Snapshots provide an easy way to capture a backup of your database at a specific point in time and are now available to all users in our Early [Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access), and we’re eager to hear your feedback. Give them a try by joining the program today!
