Today, we’re excited to announce the release of Mastra 1.0 in stable.

Back in November, we cut our first 1.0 beta. Since then, hundreds of teams have been running it in production. That feedback resulted in 94 1.0-related fixes plus several new features that didn’t make the first cut, including server adapters and composite storage.

We stabilized APIs, simplified deployment, improved observability, and addressed production issues.

Mastra 1.0 is the result of exceptional work by a talented team: Ward Peeters, Tony Kovanen, Tyler Barnes, Marvin Franchet, Eric Pinzur, Ehindero Israel, Greg Lobinski, Caleb Barnes, Daniel Lew, Taofeeq Oloderu, Nik Aiyer, Yujohn Nattrass, Lennart Jorgens, my co-founders Abhi Ayer and Shane Thomas, and our open source contributors.
