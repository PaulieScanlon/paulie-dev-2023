[As we discussed in Part I of this series](https://neon.tech/blog/development-environments-for-aws-rds-using-neon-postgres), AWS RDS is great for production, but unwieldy for dev, stage, and test databases. Businesses of all kinds ship faster with their entire DB load on Neon: Instant provisioning saves time, development is smoother with branching, and scale to zero [reduces non-prod cost by 40%](https://neon.tech/blog/development-environments-for-aws-rds-using-neon-postgres#example-rds-cost-breakdown).

But if you’re already in production on RDS, migrating a live database is painful. You don’t need to move everything over to get the development velocity and cost efficiency of non-production databases on Neon. There’s an automated, low-risk way using a Neon Twin—a synchronized copy of your RDS dataset in Neon, that updates automatically every night using pg_dump/restore and GitHub Actions.
