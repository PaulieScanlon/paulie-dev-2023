In a [previous blog post](https://neon.tech/blog/optimizing-dev-environments-in-aws-rds-with-neon-postgres-part-ii-using-github-actions-to-mirror-rds-in-neon), we showed you how to create a Neon Twin using a GitHub Action that automatically runs a pg_dump of your RDS production database and restores it to Neon on a recurring nightly schedule.

In this blog post, we’ll guide you through setting up a Slack Webhook to send notifications to a public Slack channel. This will inform your team about the latest pg_dump and restore activities.

By using Slack instead of relying on GitHub email notifications, you can avoid the need to add every developer who needs this information to the GitHub Repository where the Action runs.

We’ll also cover how to surface more detailed information about the dump and restore including the database name, size how long the job took to complete, and how to handle failures.
