In previous articles, we discussed the [advantages of using Neon as a development database](https://neon.tech/blog/development-environments-for-aws-rds-using-neon-postgres) while keeping your production workloads on AWS RDS. We covered [how to set up nightly dump/restore jobs](https://neon.tech/blog/optimizing-dev-environments-in-aws-rds-with-neon-postgres-part-ii-using-github-actions-to-mirror-rds-in-neon) using GitHub Actions to create a synchronized Neon Twin of your production database and [how to implement Slack Webhooks](https://neon.tech/blog/building-slack-notifications-to-monitor-pg_dump-and-restore-workflows%5C) for real-time notifications when the synchronization is complete.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore the reverse workflow: **how to migrate changes from your Neon Twin (your development environment) back to your AWS RDS production database**. We will automate this process through a GitHub Action that triggers when a pull request is merged.
