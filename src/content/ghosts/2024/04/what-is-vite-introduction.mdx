In the web development world, it’s hard to go more than a few days without hearing about Vite.

Its popularity has skyrocketed since its release in April 2020. At the time of writing this post, the project has blown past [64k stars on GitHub](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [over 12 million weekly downloads](https://npmtrends.com/vite) and now powers most open-source frameworks like [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/) (just to name a few).

At StackBlitz, we’re [not shy](https://x.com/ericsimons40/status/1437472325490790401) about how much we love Vite. We’ve been [supporting Vite since its beginnings in 2021](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/why-were-backing-vite/). We’re proud to count patak, a Vite core maintainer, as part of our team, and we’re hosting [ViteConf](https://viteconf.org/), a conference that showcases its vibrant ecosystem.
