_The following blog post outlines points covered in our recent webinar which you can watch in full here: [StackBlitz for Design Systems](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/stackblitz-design-systems)._

For the past several years, enterprise design systems teams have reached out to us for help replicating the workflows we enable for the maintainers of open source projects like Angular, Material UI, and Astro but within the [secure confines of their own infrastructure](https://stackblitz.com/enterprise).

That means that, despite never having worked on a design system myself, I’ve been fortunate to work with a number of design system teams and have learned a great deal about what it takes to build, maintain, and scale these initiatives at large companies.

I’m eager to share what I’ve learned with our community.
