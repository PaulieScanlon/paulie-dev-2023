Learn how to Twin your production database with Neon

## What is a Neon Twin?
A Neon Twin is a full or partial clone of your production or staging database, providing developers and teams with isolated, sandboxed environments that closely mirror production.

## Designed for efficiency
Creating a Neon Twin will streamline development workflows, enhance productivity, and help teams ship fasterâ€”all while being more cost-effective and easier to manage than traditional development/testing environments.

## Automatically synced
The workflows in this section enable automatic synchronization between your production database and your Neon Twin.
