Boost developer productivity with Neon—a flexible development sandbox for running non-production workloads.

What sets Neon apart from other Postgres providers, beyond its true serverless nature, is its focus on delivering an exceptional developer experience.

Here are some of our standout features:

## Standout features

Together, these features create a fast, flexible, and developer-friendly database experience that traditional solutions can’t match.

1. Serverless Architecture with Autoscaling: Neon automatically scales resources to match workload demand, with no manual intervention required.
2. Branching for Development and Testing: Neon enables instant branching that creates isolated copies of data and schema. This allows for safe development and testing without impacting production.
3. Integration and Compatibility: Neon supports all the latest PostgreSQL versions and numerous extensions, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of applications and frameworks.
4. Provisioning Environments: Neon simplifies the provisioning and management of environments through its console or API. New databases and branches can be spun up instantly, resources can be managed, and settings configured—either through a user-friendly console or automated API calls.
