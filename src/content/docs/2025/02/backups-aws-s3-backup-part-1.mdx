This guide will walk you through setting up an AWS S3 bucket to store your Postgres backups.

> This is part one of a two-part guide. Continue to part two here.

## Prerequisites
To complete this guide, you'll need an AWS user with the appropriate permissions to:

- Manage IAM resources: Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider and IAM roles.
- Manage S3: Create an S3 bucket and update its bucket policy.
These actions typically require AdministratorAccess or a custom IAM policy granting the necessary permissions. If you're not an administrator, ensure your user has IAM management privileges and S3 permissions.

## Setup AWS Providers and Roles
There are three parts to the AWS setup, they are:

1. Creating an OIDC Identity Provider
2. Creating a Role
3. Creating an S3 bucket and updating the S3 bucket policy
