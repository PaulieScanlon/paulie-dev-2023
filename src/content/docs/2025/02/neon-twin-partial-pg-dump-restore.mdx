Create a partial Twin of your production database

This workflow will create a partial Neon Twin using `pg_dump`, `pg_restore` and `psql`.

> To use this workflow, you'll need the Postgres connection string for your Neon database. Follow our Getting Started Guide to learn how.

## Create the workflow
To create the Twin workflow in any GitHub-hosted repository:

1. Create a new directory named `.github` at the root of your project.
2. Inside this directory, create another directory named `workflows`.
3. Within the workflows directory, create a new file named `create-neon-twin.yml`.

```shell
.github
  |-- workflows
      |-- create-neon-twin.yml
```
