Use Docker environments to connect to Neon and manage branches automatically

[Neon Local](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon_local) is a proxy service that creates a local interface to your Neon cloud database. By default, it automatically creates a new database branch when the container starts and deletes it when the container stops.

Your application connects to a local Postgres endpoint, while Neon Local handles routing and authentication to the correct project and branch. This removes the need to update connection strings when working across database branches.

## Docker compose instructions

You can add the Neon Local by adding the following to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml
db:
  image: neondatabase/neon_local:latest
  ports:
    - '5432:5432'
  environment:
    NEON_API_KEY: ${NEON_API_KEY}
    NEON_PROJECT_ID: ${NEON_PROJECT_ID}
    DRIVER: serverless
```
