In this tutorial I’ll be explaining how to use Google Sheets as a database to store the results of a user poll. I’ve used this [React](https://thenewstack.io/learn-react-start-of-a-frontend-dev-journey/) Google Sheets approach for a number of marketing campaigns. I chose this method over a more traditional Database solution for one reason: Data retrieval.

It does of course entirely depend on your requirements, but having the ability to simply share a Google Sheet with a technical or non-technical member of my team — so they can easily see captured data — has, on more than one occasion, proved really valuable.

Data is sent from the browser to a Server Action that securely posts to a Google Sheet, which stores the data. To use [Server Actions](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-a-server-side-react-app-using-vite-and-express/) in React, I’ll be using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).

On the following links you will find a Live Preview and GitHub Repository for the completed user poll application.

  I won’t be covering how to get started with Next.js, so please consult the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) if you’re not familiar with how to use Next.js.
