With [React’s evolving ecosystem](https://thenewstack.io/did-signals-just-land-in-react/), particularly with [Next.js shifting](https://thenewstack.io/vercels-next-js-14-introduces-partial-pre-rendering/) toward a “server-first” approach, applications using CSS-in-JS solutions like [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) are facing significant challenges. These CSS-in-JS libraries are inherently incompatible with the new React paradigm.

While one could argue these libraries could be updated to align with the new server-first direction, it’s important to remember that they’re maintained by unpaid open source contributors. Expecting them to completely overhaul their libraries to accommodate changes in React is a daunting and potentially unrealistic task.

Let’s look at why some CSS-in-JS solutions are unable to work in the new server-first world, then I’ll introduce you to one alternative, [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), which uses an almost identical API as styled-components

## The RSC Paradigm

This is going to turn into a long-winded explanation, but it’s important to understand how React used to work (pre-React Server Components) and how it works now ([post-RSC](https://thenewstack.io/javascript-in-2023-signals-reacts-rsc-and-full-stack-js/)).
