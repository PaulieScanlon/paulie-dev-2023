Paul Scanlon explains resumability, Qwik‚Äôs approach to solving the beastly client-side JavaScript problem, and how it differs from React.

In this post I‚Äôll attempt to explain resumability, Qwik‚Äôs approach to solving the beastly client-side JavaScript problem. I‚Äôll also explain how it differs from React.

There‚Äôs a really great introduction to Qwik over at QwikSchool.com, which covers some of the areas I‚Äôll be outlining in this article. But for me, reading is how I learn best and I learn faster when I can see a relatable comparison, which is what I‚Äôll attempt to do now using a bar and pints of beer. üç∫

## How Does React‚Äôs Hydration Work?

Imagine you walk into a bar and sit down, but the server doesn‚Äôt ask you what you want to drink, they just pour six pints of beer into a giant glass. Once they‚Äôre satisfied that the glass can hold six pints of beer, they pour it away. They then pass the empty glass over to you (the client) and proceed to pour another six pints of beer into the glass.
