In this post I’ll show you how I created a time series chart to display tag usage from blog posts published on my site paulie.dev. I was curious to see what I’d been writing about over the last few years, where the crossovers were, and if I could learn anything new.

All the data sourcing and calculations required to create a time series chart are handled by Astro on the server with only a very tiny amount of client-side JavaScript to enable interactivity.

You can see the finished demo and all the code on the following links.
