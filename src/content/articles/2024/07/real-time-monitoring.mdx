Data analysis is crucial for identifying trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. By inspecting and analyzing data, businesses can uncover valuable insights that drive innovation, optimize operations, and reveal opportunities for growth that can significantly enhance their competitive advantage.

In this article, I'll demonstrate how I used Luzmo to create a real-time dashboard that visualizes the page views from my site over the past 7 days using Luzmoâ€™s Google Analytics integration. I've displayed this data using a bar chart and set up a scheduled alert to automatically share these insights in a public Slack channel.

Below is a screenshot of my Luzmo dashboard and the corresponding alert posted to Slack. In the following sections, I'll walk you through the steps I took to achieve this.
