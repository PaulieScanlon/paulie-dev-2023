In this post, I’ll show you how I added Luzmo IQ to an Astro site and hooked it up to a Postgres database to capture analytics data about visitors to [my site](https://www.paulie.dev/).

You can see all the code referenced in this blog post on the link below:

I queried Luzmo IQ using the following prompt: “Create a chart of 'US' cities where my website visitors are located from the last 30 days.” Below is a screenshot of the chart it created for me!

Later in the post, I'll explain how you can use Luzmo IQ to enable natural language querying in your application, but first, I'd like to talk a little about why you’d want to use AI.

Let’s just back up a bit. I’m a developer, I know SQL and have carefully optimized my queries and hand crafted the visualizations seen on my [/dashboard](https://www.paulie.dev/dashboard), because I know “ahead of time” what data is available, and how I want to display it.

However, not everyone who needs access to data is a developer.
