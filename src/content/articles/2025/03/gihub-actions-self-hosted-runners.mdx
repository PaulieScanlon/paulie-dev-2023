Take full control of your GitHub Action's runner environment with DigitalOcean

In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up a Linux server on a DigitalOcean Droplet with Ubuntu installed, which you can use as a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions.

## What is a self-hosted runner?

[Self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#about-self-hosted-runners) work similarly to GitHub's default runners, but with the key difference that you manage the server yourself. While the default runners are convenient, they come with some limitationsâ€”most notably, they timeout after six hours.

This can be a challenge for long-running jobs, particularly for users of our Neon Twin workflow who may encounter issues with large databases. In these scenarios, setting up your own self-hosted runner is a more reliable solution.
