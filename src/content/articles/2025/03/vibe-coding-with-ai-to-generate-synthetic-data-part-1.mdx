Exploring vibe coding with Anthropic: Can AI handle seed data generation?

In this blog post, I’ll share my experience of vibe coding as I explore AI-driven synthetic data generation, the tests I ran, and the challenges I faced along the way.

## What is vibe coding?

Vibe coding is all about skipping the boilerplate and getting straight to the good stuff. Instead of meticulously crafting every line of code, you describe what you want in natural language and let AI handle the details, and it sounds like the right approach for generating synthetic data, right?

## Using AI for synthetic data generation

But, before I go any further, let me take a step back and explain why I started exploring AI for synthetic data generation. At Neon, I’ve been focused on improving our [Dev/Test workflows](https://neon.tech/docs/use-cases/dev-test). Simply put, this means keeping production where it is while shifting development and testing environments to Neon. You can read more about this workflow here: [From Shared Chaos to Isolated Control with Neon](https://neon.tech/blog/from-shared-chaos-to-isolated-control-with-neon).
