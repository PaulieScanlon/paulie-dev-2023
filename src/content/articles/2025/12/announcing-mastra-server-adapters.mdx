Can you use Mastra with [insert name of tech here]? Usually, yes, it’s all part of our "open relationship" philosophy 💚.

Whether it’s model providers, gateways, workflow runners, evals, memory, or storage, Mastra lets you choose the tools that work best for you. The same flexibility applies to deployment. You’ve always been able to integrate Mastra into your own server setup, but it required a little bit of [manual configuration](https://mastra.ai/guides/v1/getting-started/express#using-mastra-with-express).

We’ve now made that process much easier with [Mastra Server Adapters](https://mastra.ai/docs/v1/server/server-adapters)!
