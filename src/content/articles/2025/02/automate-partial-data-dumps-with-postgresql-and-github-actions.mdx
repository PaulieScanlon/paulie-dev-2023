Your production database is tried and tested and likely bulletproof. Merely mentioning migrating to a new provider would likely set off multiple alarms, so don't, use a Neon Twin instead.

In this post, I'll show you how to create a partial copy of your production database so you and your team can start developing on Neon while leaving production where it is.

## What is a Neon Twin?
A Neon Twin is a copy of your production database, free from the cumbersome, hard-to-manage, and expensive workflows. With a Neon Twin, you can instantly spin up a new branch, develop features, or track down bugs, all from the safety of an isolated environment using production data. Any changes made to a Twin would be migrated back to your production database using your existing workflow or pipeline.
