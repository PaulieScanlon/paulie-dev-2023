Learn how Paul created an Open-source JavaScript utility package to help convert Cloud Provider Region codes, into real
locations and country flags.

If you’ve ever worked with a database you have probably seen region codes like this, `eu-west-1` or `us-central-1`. You might have seen region codes in technical specifications or marketing materials, or in my case, the response from the CockroachDB Cloud API.

Whilst some region codes give you an indication of which country the database is running in, other codes are a little more vague. E.g `europe-central-1`, `asia-southeast-1`.

If you’re really into region codes you might have memorized which country these regions relate to, but if you’re a mere mortal like myself it would be nice if you could convert a region code into something more meaningful
