In this article, Paul Scanlon shares a super lightweight approach to creating a Donut chart using `conic-gradient()`.
There are no additional libraries to install or maintain, and there's no heavy JavaScript that needs to be downloaded by
the browser in order for them to work. Let's explore!

CSS is amazing — I’m regularly surprised at how far it has come in the years I’ve been using it (~2005 – present). One such surprise came when I noticed this tweet by Shruti Balasa which demonstrated how to create a pie chart using conic-gradient().

It’s fairly straightforward. Here’s a code snippet:

```css
div {
  background: conic-gradient(red 36deg, orange 36deg 170deg, yellow 170deg);
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
