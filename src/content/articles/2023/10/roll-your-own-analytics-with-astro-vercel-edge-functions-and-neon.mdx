In this post, I’ll explain how you can “roll your own” version of Google Analytics using Astro, Vercel Edge Functions and Neon.

I’ve prepared a sample repository showing the implementation for a site built using Astro and deployed to Vercel.

- ⚙️ [Astro sample repository](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/neon-edge-analytics-astro-sample)

I’ve used this same approach for my own site, paulie.dev, and I’ll explain how I’ve used the data to create the visualisations on my dashboard.

For good measure, I’ve also created a [Next.js sample repository](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/neon-edge-analytics-nextjs-sample), but I won’t be covering that in this post.
