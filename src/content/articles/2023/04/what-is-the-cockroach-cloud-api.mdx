In this post you‚Äôll learn about the CockroachDB Cloud API and how I‚Äôve used it to create an application Dashboard with Next.js. Using the API you can build a custom interface to meet your organization‚Äôs needs, or perform various tasks relating to your database infrastructure.

I‚Äôll also explain how I‚Äôve used NextAuth.js to create conditional authorization rules to facilitate greater control over the functionality.

You can get a feel for what I‚Äôve built using the links below.
