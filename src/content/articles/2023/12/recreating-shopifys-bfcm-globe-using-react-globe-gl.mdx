Developer Paul Scanlon shows how to recreate Shopify's 3D Thanksgiving globe, using a React component for globe data visualization.

Did you see this year’s BFCM (Black Friday Cyber Monday) Globe from Shopify? I did, and loved it. Every year the Shopify team knocks it out of the park and this year was no exception! However, unless you possess NASA level WebGL engineering skills, creating a 3D globe is hard. Fortunately react-globe.gl by Vasco Asturiano is here to help. I’ve used this library on a number of occasions, but this time I wanted to see how close I could get to Shopify’s BFCM ‘23 globe.

You can see a preview and all the code referenced in this post on the links below.
