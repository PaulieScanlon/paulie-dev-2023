A closer look at how to use Neon's serverless driver with Vercel Edge Functions.

In this post, I’d like to introduce Neon’s [serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) which is suitable for use with Vercel Edge Functions. I’ll explain how to use it with Next.js and a free [Neon serverless Postgres database](https://neon.tech/).

Here’s a demo I created. I’ve called it Ping Thing.

## What does Ping Thing do?

When users click Ping, the app sends a request to an Edge Function deployed on Vercel, where the geolocation data is extracted from the request and posted to a Neon database. I’ve added a 3D globe to visualise the journey and calculated some statistics about the request.

Give it a Ping and see your data journey
