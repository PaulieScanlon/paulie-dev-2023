If you've found yourself here, you're probably looking for a way to send an email using GitHub Actions. Great—I needed to do this too! I'll briefly explain why, then jump straight into the code.

I was exploring the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) to better understand how to manage branches. In [Neon](https://neon.tech/), branches work similarly to code branches: you can create an isolated copy of your production database to work on safely without messing up production. However, in a large team where developers are constantly spinning up new branches, things can quickly get out of hand. I wanted a way to track when a branch was last used and automatically delete any that were older than a certain threshold.

My goal was simple: Set up a GitHub Action that runs nightly at midnight to identify stale database branches and delete any older than 30 days. I got it working and shared it with the team—only to face some pushback. Deleting a developer's branch without warning felt a bit harsh. Fair point.

Since my method for detecting and deleting stale branches runs as a recurring GitHub Action, I decided to first notify developers via email. If their branch was flagged as stale, they'd get a warning. If they didn't take action, well... I'd proceed with the ruthless cleanup.


## Prerequisites
- This post uses Gmail as the email provider
    - You'll need to enable Two-factor authentication (2FA) in your Google account
- You'll need access to both **Actions** and **Settings** for a GitHub repository 


## Getting Started

Setting this up involves a few steps. While you can send emails directly from the Action workflow using an [SMTP client](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/send-e-mail-smtp), I found it easier to use [Nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) and run it from a JavaScript file, which is triggered by the Action workflow.

I'll start with the code and repository setup, then move on to configuring the Google Account.


### Code and repository setup
In your repository, create the following directories and files. The `send-email.mjs` file handles sending the email, while `send-email.yml` is the GitHub Action workflow that schedules the task and triggers the JavaScript file.

```shell
.github
  |-- scripts
      |-- send-email.mjs  
  |-- workflows
      |-- send-email.yml
```

### package.json
Check the `type` in package.json is set to `"module"`. This enables you to use ES6 syntax in your JavaScript, for example:

```json
"type": "module",
```

## Install dependencies
You'll need two dependencies: [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) for sending emails and [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to access environment variables stored as GitHub Secrets within the JavaScript function.

```
npm install nodemailer dotenv
```

### GitHub Action
Copy the below code snippet and paste it into `send-email.yml`

```yml
name: Send Email

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD }}

jobs:
  send-email:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm install

      - name: Send Email
        run: |
          node .github/scripts/send-email.mjs
```

The schedule at the top follows [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07) and is currently set to run every night at midnight (UTC). Feel free to adjust this based on your needs. The `workflow_dispatch` event allows you to trigger the workflow manually from the GitHub UI.  

I'll cover how to create the `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` environment variable in a later step.  

The remaining steps involve checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, and running `send-email.mjs`.  

### JavaScript function
Copy the below code snippet and paste it into `send-email.mjs`

```javascript

import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';
import 'dotenv/config';

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'Gmail',
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: 'pauliescanlon@gmail.com',
    pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD,
  },
});

(async () => {
// Neon API logic ran here, returning values included in the HTML body of the email.  
  let branch_id = 'little-salad-123';
  let days = 3;
  let email = 'developer-abc@acme.co';

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: '"Warning | DevOps" <pauliescanlon@gmail.com>',
      to: email,
      subject: 'Stale Branch Detected!',
      html: `Branch: <b>${branch_id}</b> will be deleted in <b>${days}</b> days`,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
})();

```

You'll need to update the email address in the `createTransport` constructor. The `user` should match the email address associated with the App password, which I'll explain in the next step.  

In the `sendMail` function, you can configure the settings to suit your needs. I've noticed that it doesn't matter which email address you use in the `from` field; the email will always be sent from the address defined in the `user` field of the `createTransport` constructor.

If you'd prefer to test this locally instead of running the GitHub Action, use the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node .github/scripts/send-email.mjs
```

## Google Account configuration
In your browser head over to your Google Account security settings: [Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security?gar=WzEzMywiMjM2NzM2Il0&utm_source=account-marketing-page&utm_medium=go-to-account-button). Scroll down to **How you sign in to Google** and check that **2-Step verification** is switched on. 

Now visit [App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), and create a new App. Once you've given your App a name, you'll see the below screen.

/>

Create a new file at the root of your project named `.env` and create a new variable named `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, for example:

```shell
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=123 abc
```
Copy the App password and paste it into your `.env` file. You'll only be shown this once. If you don't make a note of the App password, you'll have to delete the App and create a new one. 

## GitHub Secrets
In your repository, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**. Then, create a new secret named `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` under **Repository secrets** and add the value of your App password.

/>

## Test the Action
To test the Action, go to **Actions** and click on **Send Email**. Then, click **Run workflow**, and in the dropdown, click **Run workflow** again.

## Finished

If you've done all of the above, you should have received an email! Here's an example of what mine currently looks like.
