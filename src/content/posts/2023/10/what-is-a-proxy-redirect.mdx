In this Post I'm going to describe an approach I've used in my last three jobs when creating Product Demos. It allows me to build things this: [https://neon.tech/demos/ping-thing](https://neon.tech/demos/ping-thing).

My demos look like they live on the main company URL e.g `https://neon.tech/demos/name-of-demo`, but are actually deployed somewhere completely different.

This approach goes by many names.

- Proxy Redirect
- Corporate Proxy
- Reverse Proxy

or, if you're deploying to Vercel or Netlify, they're called Rewrites.

But before we get on to **Proxy Redirects**, lemme just explain "ordinary" **Redirects**.

## What is a Redirect?

Let's say you you have a site, `www.example.com`. You have a page at `www.example.com/about-us`, but want to change it to `www.example.com/about`. You can't just rename the `/about-us` page to `/about` because anyone who'd previously had the `/about-us` link and visits that URL will end up seeing the 404 ([Not Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404)) page.

The normal solution is to add a redirect from `/about-us` to `/about`. With a redirect in place any visitors to `/about-us` will be redirected to `/about`.

One of the key tenets of a redirect is that **the URL changes** when the redirect occurs. Users might only very briefly see `/about-us` in the browser address bar but, after a quick flash, they'll end up seeing `/about`.

All's well, that ends well.

## Redirect a Product Demo

I've seen a few folks use this approach, and in a moment i'll explain why it's a bad idea, but first i'll explain the how and the why.

If you're building a Product Demo it'll probably have a "shelf life", and by that I mean, after an initial wave of activity it'll be forgotten. For a number of reasons it's a bad idea to add your "demo" code to your companies main website just so you can share a real, company branded URL with the world.

But, by adding a redirect to your companies main website to your Product Demo, you can superficially obtain a real company URL to share with the world.

This works by adding a redirect to your companies main website server config that will redirect users e.g:

1. from: `www.example.com/demos/name-of-demo`
2. to: `www.name-of-demo.vercel.app`

As before with the `/about-us` example, any user visiting `www.example.com/demos/name-of-demo` would quickly be redirected to `www.name-of-demo.vercel.app`.

This is largely pointless and by opting to use approach you've not solved a problem, but you have created one.

### The Analytics Problem

Naturally you'll want to add Analytics to your Product Demo so you can measure how effective it was. But, you can't add your companies main Analytics tracking code to your demo because many Analytics tools will block requests that come from a different domain to the one configured in the admin settings.

Your only other option here is to create a new Analytics account and tracking code. Whilst this will indeed capture page views, all those lovely numbers are now in a different account and won't be contributing to your companies overall traffic goals. Not to mention, at some point, someone is gonna ask you to add your numbers to their "report" which will likely be a manual task. Yuck!

## What is a Proxy Redirect?

A Proxy redirect is different. Taking the above example, what we want is to "proxy redirect" users:

1. from: `www.example.com/demos/name-of-demo`
2. to: `www.example.com/demos/name-of-demo`

And no, that's not a mistake. One of the key tenets of a Proxy Redirect is the **URL stays the same**.

Ordinarily, as I mentioned above, the server wants to respond with a 404 because it knows the "to" location doesn't exits but, instead of the server sending a 404 status code, you can override it and tell it to send a 200 ([OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)) but, you can also tell it to silently, and in the background, render the site that's been deployed to `www.name-of-demo.vercel.app` all without changing the URL seen the in the address bar... and the world will never know!

Back in my early web development career (~2000) stuff like this was possible, but it required some pretty hardcore backend config. Luckily for you, in the modern day, all you have to do is copy and paste some code from the docs. (you read the docs right?)

How you do this will depend on what technology your companies site is built with and where it's deployed. If your companies main website is deployed to either Netlify or Vercel the following links will explain how to configure Rewrites.

- [Netlify: Rewrites and proxies](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/)
- [Vercel: Rewrites on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites)

## How to Create a Proxy Redirect Product Demo

This will **entirely** depend on what technology your companies main site is built with and where it's deployed, **AND** what technology your demo site is built with and where it's deployed ‚òùÔ∏è.

The steps i'm about to explain relate to the following two sites and there a configuration changes required for both of them for a Proxy Redirect to work:

- [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/)
  - Built with Next.js
  - Deployed to Vercel (_using our main Neon account_)
- [neon.tech/demos/ping-thing](https://neon.tech/demos/ping-thing)
  - Built with Next.js
  - Deployed to Vercel (_under the same Neon account_)

## 1. Proxy Redirect - The Site

"The Site" relates to your companies main site, in my case that's [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/).

To configure the server I add the following `rewrites()` to `next.config.js`. This tells the server than any requests from `/demos/ping-thing` should silently, and in the background be **rewritten** to `https://ping-thing.vercel.app/demos/ping-thing`.

```javascript
// ./next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/demos/ping-thing',
        destination: 'https://ping-thing.vercel.app/demos/ping-thing',
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

## 2. Proxy Redirect - The Demo

"The Demo" relates to your demo site, in my case that's [neon.tech/demos/ping-thing](https://neon.tech/demos/ping-thing).

To configure the demo, I add the following to `next.config.js`.

```javascript
// ./next.config.js

const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

module.exports = {
  assetPrefix: isProd ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX : undefined,
  basePath: isProd ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX : undefined,
};
```

The value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX` is as follows, and pay attention, there's no trailing slash!

### NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX

#### Production

```shell
// .env || .env.local.production

NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX=/demos/ping-thing
```

#### Development

In the development environment I set the value to _nothing_. This allows me to continue developing on `https://localhost:3000` rather than `https://localhost:300/demos/ping-thing`. This step isn't necessary but I find it more convenient.

```shell
// .env.local.development

NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX=

```

### assetPrefix

This is a tricky one. For the most part the `assetPrefix` deals with where static assets are located. In a lot of cases though, I've found I needed to prefix the `src` so that `next/image` doesn't error ü§∑.

```javascript
<Image
  src={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REWRITE_PREFIX}/static/cta-elephant.avif`}
  width={1684}
  height={964}
  alt='Neon Elephant'
/>
```

### basePath

The `basePath` is for things like `.js` and `.css`. If you don't set this, when your Next.js site is bundled it won't have the correct paths to the JavaScript and CSS that make your demo work, and look like your demo.

The `basePath` is important because with my demo its no longer deployed to the root of it's own domain. Its deployed to `/demos/ping-thing`, and not only that it's not ever on it's own domain... so you gotta give the bundler a helping hand and provide some additional paths to help the HTML correctly link to the relevant `.js` and `.css` files.

## Analytics

This one was super easy for me. I used the same setup as [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) because it's the same tech e.g Next.js. Yours may differ.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM` is the Google Analytics tracking ID for [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) which I can also use because [Ping Thing](https://neon.tech/demos/ping-thing), for all intents and purposes, lives on [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/). I want all page views to be tracked by our main Google Analytics account and I want them to show up in our reports.

```javascript
// pages/_document.js

import Script from 'next/script';
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

const Document = () => {
  const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

  return (
    <Html lang='en'>
      <Head>
        {isProd ? (
          <Script id='google-analytics' strategy='afterInteractive'>
            {`
              (function (w, d, s, l, i) {
                w[l] = w[l] || []
                w[l].push({ 'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(), event: 'gtm.js' })
                var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
                  j = d.createElement(s),
                  dl = l != 'dataLayer' ? '&l=' + l : ''
                j.async = true
                j.src = 'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=' + i + dl
                f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f)
              })(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', '${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM}')
            `}
          </Script>
        ) : null}
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
        {isProd ? (
          <Script
            src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM}`}
            strategy='afterInteractive'
          />
        ) : null}
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
};

export default Document;
```

## Final Thoughts

I've gotta be honest, It is a bit of a ball ache, but it is worth the trouble. Using this approach for Product Demos allows you to share the URL with the world, promote your companies brand (and product) and track all the Analytics in the right place.

If you've only ever built "apps" for zero users I can understand why you wouldn't know this stuff, but **websites are different to apps**. Websites are often "legacy", you have to carefully maintain them, you have to think about what it is you're doing before you do it. You can't just _"ship fast and break things"_, or whatever bullshit Vercel are telling you to do. You have to take your time, do it once, then you can get on with your life. Why on earth you'd want to go back and make changes to things because you can't be bothered to think ahead is beyond me. It's a website, you know how it needs to work. It has pages and links!

Websites are, in a lot of cases, the source of truth, the bloodline for the business, your zero user app that you built in a weekend is not!

...anyway

Some issues I do know about.

1. On Netlify you can't proxy between two different Netlify accounts. This might happen if you had the "main" Netlify account, and then maybe a different one for Developer Relations / Product Demos.
2. You can't `redirect` a `rewrite`. We had this problem at Neon. Before you go ahead and deploy a `rewrite`, double, triple, check the URLs you want to use. All of my demos have always lived on `/demos/name-of-demo`. At Neon it was decided we'd put them on the root `/name-of-demo` (bad idea), and then later it was decided we'd put them on `/demos/`. No big deal right, we can always change stuff later.

It was a such a pain in the arse to make this change, it took me half a day to rewire all the pages so users who had the link already wouldn't see a 404. So, do yourself a favour, don't be agile, don't ship fast, take your time, make a decision and stick with it!

And here are some I made earlier, I've also linked to the repos to show you the code isn't part of the main company website's repo.
